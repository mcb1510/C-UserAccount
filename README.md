# Overview

This is a program that will allow the user to create and login into an account. The program will then store the user's credentials in a file.

I created this program to demonstrate the use of C++ lenguage. 

The program will contain the following C++ Syntax:

- Variables 
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Data structure from STL (List)

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Mingw-w64 (compiler)
- Github

This program uses C++ and list as one STL. Also it uses the libraries iostream for input and ouput, Fstream to read and write to a file, and the string class.
